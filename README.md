# Lunox Bot Privacy Policy

 
**`HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR BOT SECURE?`**

My bot is hosted on DigitalOcean with security measures in place. I have put the token in an env file, so it cannot be accessed by anyone. My account has 2FA enabled, and my hosting provider ensures full security on my virtual machine.

**`WHAT DISCORD DATA DO YOU STORE?`**

We store server IDs for 24/7 voice channels and user IDs for custom queues and song lists. This data is deleted when the queue ends in that guild. We do not store any other data from any guild or user.

**`HOW LONG DO WE STORE DATA FOR?`**

We store guild IDs until the server admin or owner disables the 24/7 command. User IDs are stored for custom queues so that users can easily manage their queues.

**`HOW CAN I CONTACT YOU IF I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR BOT?`**

If you have any concerns, you can contact me on my support server at https://discord.gg/kNdSkHchzH.

**`HOW CAN I REQUEST DATA TO BE REMOVED?`**

Users can contact me as a bot developer by joining the support server of the bot, sending me a DM on Discord, or emailing me.

Thank you.
